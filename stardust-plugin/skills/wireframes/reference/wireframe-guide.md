# Wireframe Guide

Wireframes are low-fidelity HTML pages that show page **structure** only — section order, relative sizing, content density, spatial relationships. Visual design (colors, fonts, proportions) is intentionally absent; it belongs to `/stardust:design`.

## Styling — Grey Mode Only

Wireframes at this stage are **always grey**. No brand colors, no real fonts, no polish.

- Background: `#f5f5f5`.
- Section blocks, tiles, and cards in shades of grey (`#e5e5e5`, `#d0d0d0`, `#bbb`).
- Typography: `system-ui, sans-serif`. No web fonts.
- Placeholder text renders as grey bars at the height of real text (don't fake-type Lorem ipsum — structural bars make relative sizing easier to judge).
- Images render as grey rectangles with a label (e.g., "HERO IMAGE 16:9").
- Buttons: dark grey rectangles with a light grey label. All one shape. No colored CTAs.
- The absence of visual design is a feature: it forces the reviewer to evaluate structure on its own.

If you catch yourself reaching for `brand-profile.json` to color something, stop. That work belongs to `/stardust:design`.

## HTML Structure

Each wireframe is a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS.

### Data Attributes

Every section must include semantic data attributes for the Build stage to parse:

```html
<section data-section="hero" data-intent="emotional hook" data-layout="full-bleed">
  <!-- section content -->
</section>

<section data-section="features" data-intent="value proposition" data-layout="contained" data-items="3">
  <!-- section content -->
</section>
```

**Required attributes:**
- `data-section` — descriptive name (not an EDS block type). Use natural language: "hero", "features", "social-proof", "recipe-showcase", "closing-cta"
- `data-intent` — why this section exists: "emotional hook", "build trust", "drive action"
- `data-layout` — spatial hint: "full-bleed", "contained", "split-media", "grid"

**Optional attributes:**
- `data-items` — number of repeated items (cards, features, testimonials)
- `data-media` — media type: "image", "video", "animation", "none"
- `data-interactive` — if section has interaction: "carousel", "filter", "calculator", "tabs"

### Metadata Block

Each wireframe includes a JSON metadata block linking to its briefing:

```html
<script type="application/json" id="wireframe-meta">
{
  "page": "Homepage",
  "briefing": "homepage.md",
  "mode": "grey",
  "sections": ["hero", "features", "social-proof", "recipe-showcase", "closing-cta"]
}
</script>
```

## Visual Rendering Rules

1. **Sections are full-width dividers.** Each section is visually distinct — separated by whitespace or background color changes.
2. **Grey placeholder bars** for text: 60% width for headings, 40% for subheadings, 80-100% for body lines.
3. **Grey rectangles** for images/video with centered label text ("lifestyle image", "demo video").
4. **Rounded rectangles** for buttons/CTAs with label text ("Primary CTA", "Secondary").
5. **Card layouts** show 3-4 items side by side with image placeholder + text bars.
6. **No real copy.** Section labels (e.g., "Hero", "Features") appear as small annotations above or beside the section, not as content.
7. **Responsive.** Wireframes should be viewport-responsive — stack to single column on narrow viewports.

## Annotations — Required

Grey bars alone don't convey what each block is *for*. Every content block must be paired with a short annotation so a reviewer can evaluate the flow without guessing.

Use three annotation styles:

- **`.note`** — italic grey caption with a left border, placed next to a bar or group of bars. Describes what the block represents (e.g., "Eyebrow — short kicker above the headline", "Body — 4–6 lines covering skills-not-one-shot, inspectable, re-runnable").
- **`.caption`** — small grey line below a media placeholder, CTA group, or card. Describes content direction or candidate treatments (e.g., "Diagram: fuzzy 'need' on the left → concrete EDS site on the right").
- **Inline labels on repeated items** — pipeline nodes, host tiles, and card grids should carry a short label identifying *which* item they are (e.g., "01 · brand", "Claude Code · AVAILABLE"), not just "item 1 / 2 / 3".

Annotations are **structural direction**, not final copy. They tell the reviewer "this is what the block is for" so they can judge whether the section belongs, in what order, at what weight. They are removed in `/stardust:design` when real copy takes over.

Minimum annotation density: every major block (headline group, body group, media, CTA row) gets at least one `.note` or `.caption`. If a block is self-evident from its shape alone (e.g., a section label pill), no annotation needed.

### Annotation CSS

Include these styles in every wireframe so annotations render consistently:

```css
.note {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #777;
  font-style: italic;
  margin: 6px 0 10px;
  padding-left: 10px;
  border-left: 2px solid #c8c8c8;
}
.caption {
  font-size: 11px;
  color: #888;
  margin-top: 6px;
}
```

## Content Reuse & Fragments (Multi-Page Sites)

For multi-page sites, pages should be connected through shared content — not just navigation links. Content reuse means the same card, quote, or highlight appears on multiple pages, authored once and embedded everywhere.

### Fragment Data Attributes

Mark reusable content sections with fragment attributes so the Build stage can implement them as shared fragments:

```html
<!-- On the SOURCE page (where content is authored): -->
<section data-section="recipe-grid" data-fragment="recipe-card" data-fragment-role="source">

<!-- On CONSUMING pages (where content is reused): -->
<section data-section="recipe-teaser" data-fragment="recipe-card" data-fragment-role="reuse" data-fragment-source="/recipes">
```

**Fragment attributes:**
- `data-fragment` — fragment type identifier (e.g., "recipe-card", "testimonial-card", "capability-highlight")
- `data-fragment-role` — either "source" (canonical home) or "reuse" (consuming page)
- `data-fragment-source` — path to the source page (only on reuse sections)

### Fragment Manifest in Metadata

The wireframe metadata block should include a `fragments` map documenting which content types are shared across pages:

```json
{
  "page": "Homepage",
  "briefing": "homepage.md",
  "mode": "branded",
  "sections": ["hero", "capabilities-tease", "recipe-showcase", "stories-teaser", "closing-cta"],
  "fragments": {
    "capability-highlight": { "source": "/capabilities", "reusedOn": ["/"] },
    "recipe-card": { "source": "/recipes", "reusedOn": ["/", "/capabilities", "/stories"] },
    "testimonial-card": { "source": "/stories", "reusedOn": ["/", "/capabilities", "/recipes"] }
  }
}
```

### Common Fragment Patterns

| Fragment Type | Source Page | Typical Reuse |
|---|---|---|
| Recipe cards (image, title, meta) | Recipes page | Homepage, product pages |
| Testimonial quotes (stars, quote, author) | Stories/testimonials page | Homepage, product pages, recipe pages |
| Capability highlights (stat, label, description) | Capabilities/product page | Homepage, recipe pages, stories pages |
| CTA banner (headline, button) | Shared across all | Every page (closing CTA) |

### Design Rules for Reused Content

1. **The homepage is a hub.** It should pull excerpts from every major content page — capabilities, recipes, stories — with clear CTAs to explore more.
2. **Inner pages cross-link to at least two other pages.** Each inner page should include at least one reused content section from a sibling page, plus a link to a third.
3. **Reused sections are excerpts, not duplicates.** Show 3-4 items from a source that has 6+. This creates a "see more" motivation.
4. **Every reused section has a cross-link CTA.** A "See All Recipes" button, "Read Their Stories" link, or "Explore Capabilities" button connects to the source page.
5. **Annotate reused sections.** Use HTML comments and annotation labels to make the reuse relationship visible in the wireframe: `<!-- Recipe teaser — content reused from /recipes -->`.
